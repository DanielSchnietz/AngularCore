# AngularCoreApp
Frontend with Angular and Angular Material |
Backend C#.NET Core API |
Datastorage Google Firestore Cloud
Next day to work on 13.11  

To Do:  
refacturing of services, as they are not object oriented,  
add more classes,  
add interfaces,  
start learning api  
add automapper to make hardcoded mapping unnecessary,  
change calculate and calculation names and change calculation class so its more object oriented,  



There is still a lot of work to do, but you should be able to get some first impressions on how i´m working and whats my goal with this app.  

Unittests going to be added in Frontend before going on further with development.
"Calculation Learning" API to be added in Backend.  
Extra class for checking responses will be added.  
Json serialisation will be added to more responses.  
Extra folder for DTO´s will be added.  
Models will be completed ( e.g. adding more than just required).    
Interfaces will be added .  



Additional features that are coming later in the development process:
The User can change his previous made Calculations.
The User can login.
The User has his own Menu for Configuration e.g. the "Calculation Learning" API.
The User will be supported by AI in further future  .
More features to be added...
